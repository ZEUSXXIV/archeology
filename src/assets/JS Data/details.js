    Description:"Historians believe that this Masjid was built during the Adilshahi rule over Goa in Medieval time.  It is built with laterite and the tank is dotted with Mehrab arches and is similar to those of the Safa Masjid, Ponda.  Laterite columns of the old Masjid, capped with basalt can be still seen here at Surla Tar.\n A dargah of a Pir (locally known as Pira-der) is located near the Masjid.  This ‘Pir’ has great significance in the cultural traditions of this village.  Ruins of a pathway (paved in laterite), locally known as ‘Paaz’ leading to the old ferry point can also be seen in the vicinity of this Mosque.  "

    Title:"Fort of Mormugao, Mormugao.",
    Description:"Built by Viceroy D. Francisco da Gama, Conde de Vidigueira and the Admiral of Portuguese India, who laid its foundation stone in April 1624.  It overlooks the port of Mormugao.  The fort included three magazines, towering bulwarks, a chapel and accommodation for a garrison.  It was built to protect the harbour situated near the Vasco da Gama town.  Primarily, Mormugao was generalized to be the capital of the Portuguese empire, hence the fort was erected and in 1703 the Viceroy moved into the town.  The Maratha warriors continued to attack the town and the fort, finally the Portuguese gave up the township in preference for Old Goa. "
